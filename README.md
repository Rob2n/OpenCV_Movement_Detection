# OpenCV Movement Detection Workshop

OpenCV is a library that allows image manipulation, recognition, and many more.

In this workshop we will build a program that can detect movement in a video feed.

## Installation

First you will need **Python3**.

Then, use the package manager [pip3](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install all the requirements.

```bash
pip3 install opencv-python imutils
```
You will also need to have the [live_feed.mp4](live_feed.mp4) file to test your program.

In [movement_detection.py](movement_detection.py) you will find fully commented code to explain all the inner workings of the program

## Run

To run it, simply type :
```bash
python3 movement_detection.py live_feed.mp4
```
